Develop a CNN model for yellow-blue lane deflection detection in photographs.

1.Modify the image dataset and make it ready for modeling with an CNN.

2.Train a CNN classifier with Pytorch. 

3.Evaluate a CNN model on a test dataset and make predictions on new photos.

4.Import your CNN classifier to virtual robot to help it run a lap on the yellow-blue lane.
